Hello,

Node is a server-side programming that everywhere booming today. As part of that, here we have few small examples in the repository.

I'm updating the content on my own statement based on my learning and understanding about the Node. 

Javascript is the Scripting language that developed to run the web app on the browser engine.
Anguar, React are the frameworks/Libraries of the Javascript language and used for developing the Front-End application.
Whereas NodeJs is the open-source cross platform runtime environment which supports the Javascript ro run outside the browser.
Node is neither a programming language and nor a framework, it's just a runtime environment.

Node.js is a platform for building the i/o applications which are server-side event-driven and made using JavaScript.
