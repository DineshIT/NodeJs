Node Modules is a simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple Javascript files which can be used throughout the Node Js application.

There are three types of Modules in Node:

    1. Core Modules
    2. Local File Modules
    3. External/ Third party Modules

    Core Modules:
    Node.js is a light weight framework. The core modules include bare minimum functionalities of Node.js.
    However, you need to import the core module first in order to use it in your application. 

    Local File Modules:
    Local Modules are the modules that are created locally in NodeJs application.
    These modules includes different functionalities of your application in separate files and folders.
    These modules could be reused throughout the application by importing.

    External/ Third-Party Modules:
    
    The 3rd party modules can be downloaded using NPM (Node Package Manager).
    3rd party modules can be install inside the project folder or globally.
